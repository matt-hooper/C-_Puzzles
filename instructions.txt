.NET Framework v3.5 must be installed on the system.

A directory called CodingQuestions must be created on the desktop.
Directories labelled with coding exercise names (e.g. Question1, Question2, ...) must be created within.
A different Question.cs file (from for example Average\Question.cs, Complex\Question.cs, etc) must be copied into each Question* directory.
The file CompileAndRun.cmd must be copied into each Question directory.
The directory nunit must be copied into the CodingQuestions directory.
Be sure not to leave the Answer.cs files lying around...

Final structure:

Desktop
	CodingQuestions
		nunit
		Question1
			CompileAndRun.cmd
			Question.cs
		Question2
			CompileAndRun.cmd
			Question.cs
		Question3
			CompileAndRun.cmd
